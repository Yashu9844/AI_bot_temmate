## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Database schema changes

Apply schema changes with `drizzle-kit push` only (`bun run db:push`). Never use migrations: do not run `drizzle-kit generate` or `drizzle-kit migrate`, and do not create a `drizzle/` migrations folder or migration scripts.

This is a development project. There is no backwards compatibility and the data is worthless. Prefer data loss: never backfill, migrate, or preserve existing rows, and never spend effort on keeping old data working. Every schema change means a clean slate.
